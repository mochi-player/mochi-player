# mochi-player Components

These are standalone components built for mochi-player but can be used for other projects. Each has its own `requirements.txt` and `__main__.py` demonstrating its functionality.

## Testing Component

```bash
# from main directory

# activate environment (see /README.md for setup instructions)
source venv/bin/activate

# Run component (where ${component_directory} is the component)
python3 -m mochi_player.components.${component_directory}`
```
